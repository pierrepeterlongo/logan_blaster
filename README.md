# logan_blaster: Blast a query against Logan data

Align genomic sequences with [Logan](https://github.com/IndexThePlanet/Logan/) contigs.

## Two main modes
1. From a query and a list of Logan accessions.  
2. From a [Logan-Search](https://logan-search.org/) session id. The query and Logan accessions are then automaticaly retreived.

In any case, for each accession, `logan_blaster` 
1. Downloads the Logan contigs,
2. Recruits contigs that contain at least one shared k-mer (k=17 by default) with the query (uses `[back_to_sequences](https://github.com/pierrepeterlongo/back_to_sequences)`), 
3. Runs a local blast between the query and this subset of contigs.
4. Analyses the blast results: prints the portion(s) of the query matched by at least contig of the accession



## Requires 
- blast: *on mac* `brew install blast` or look at [blast installation web page](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/)
- back_to_sequences: see back_to_sequences installation [web page](https://b2s-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#installation])
- jq: see [jq installation web page](https://jqlang.org/)

## Running the `logan_blaster.sh` script

```bash
./logan_blaster.sh
  Usage: ./logan_blaster.sh --session <logan seesion ID> or (--query <query_file.fa> --accessions <accessions.txt>) [--delete] [--kmer-size <k>] [--limit <n>]
  Options:
  Input choice1: session ID
    -s, --session     Logan session ID, eg. kmviz-b2bce461-ca13-4a45-b0b4-6c894eacf103
  Input choice2: accessions and query files
    -a, --accessions  Path to accessions.txt file. Containing one accession per line)
    -q, --query       Path to query fasta file
  Global options:
    -u, --unitigs     Consider the unitigs verison of the accessions instead of contigs
    -k, --kmer-size K-mer size for sequence recruitment with back_to_sequences (default: 17)
    -l, --limit     Limit number of accessions to process from accession file (default: no limit)
    -d, --delete    Delete recruited accessions and accessions files after processing (default: keep all files)
    -h, --help      Show this help message
```

## Example running from session.
```bash
./logan_blaster.sh -s kmviz-b2bce461-ca13-4a45-b0b4-6c894eacf103
```

## Example running from accessions and query files.
This usage enables to select specific accessions to process, also ordering them, and to provide any custom query file.

```bash
./logan_blaster.sh  -a example/accessions.txt -q example/query.fa
```

## Output format.
In the created directory (named with either the session name or the query name), in the sub `alignments` directory, files named `synth*` contain this piece of information: 

```bash
query    1  CTTCCCTCTAGAACGGGACGAGGTGATGCCCCCACCCATCTCGCACCCCCCATGTGAAAGGCTCACATTCCCGAAGGGGC
            ---aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb

query   81  TTCCCTGGGCTCCGAAGGTCAGGGAGAAGGATATTGAGATGTTCCTTGAAAACAGTCGCAGCAAATTCATTGGCTACACG
            aaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbcccccccccbbbbbcdddccccccdddddddccbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

In this case, except for the first three nucleotides, the full query was aligned to at least one contig. Some portions were aligned to two contigs (positions labeled 'b'), or three contigs (positions labeled 'c'), and so on.
All positions aligned to more than 26 contigs are labeled 'Z'.
